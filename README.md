## Developing Locally 
0. First you need to get the files on your local machine... To do that open github by clicking the github icon (see image below). That will open the repo that was automatically created.  Then clone that repo locally.

0. You should now see all the files in your local machine. 

### How to run / develop streamlit on your own machine
I would first just do `pip install streamlit`, however, you can also run the requirements. 

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
To run any streamlit app, you just type in `streamlit run <name_of_app_file.py>`. Above we are running the streamlit app that is coded in the `streamlit_app.py` file.  

### Editing your app
0. Open the `streamlit_app.py` file in your favorite IDE text editor.
0. Open the webpage of the [streamlit cheat sheet](https://cheat-sheet.streamlit.app/)

### Create a simple bio page. 
0. Create a new python file named `bio.py`. 
0. Open it and first, at the top include `import streamlit as st`. 
0. Add your name via any of the text methods listed in the cheat sheet. (My favorite is `st.markdown("# Hi, I'm Zack")`).  
0.0 Streamlit markdown uses Github Flavored Markdown. Here is a [cheat sheet for github flavored markdown formatting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
